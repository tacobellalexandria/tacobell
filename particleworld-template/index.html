  <p>Description: </p>
  <p> This is a code that simulates a cloud of smoke. Some people call clouds of smoke a hotbox.</p>

  <p> // fixing the glitch in particles
    for (let i = particles.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      let p = particles[i];
    }
     in this code snippet, I am fixing the slight glitch of the particles caused by the splice. I watched the coding train to help figure this out.

   <p> Object Oriented Programming is the use of classes to reutilize the same code in different places. A class is a representation of an object that contains attributes and different functions. An instance is like the result of the blueprint established by the class. OOP is useful when you want to integrate code snippets into various projects because they are self contained. They can be especially useful in simulations like our particle system. 
       The object i created is particles that simulate the appearance of smoke. Some properties and methods I used were opacity, finished, and display. The behaviors I created were manipulating spreed to have the smoke rise and fade.
