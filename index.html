        imagine if a code was created to break the boundaries of the 3D and allow us to see what the naked eye cannot.
         As mere humans,  we and our capabilities of sight are limited to the third dimension. However this does NOT mean that what we can’t see isn’t there. 

        “Unseen Life” uses an AI machine learning tool that tracks body movement and body parts to help us see the life our eyes cannot- through the screen. 
        
        Along with any basic movement, users are able to trigger the detection of “life” and see how other interdimensional beings exist on the human body.

    <h3 id="process1"> design and composition</h3>

        <ul>
            
            <li>i decided to use poseNet because it worked well with my narrative</li>
            <li>users use the camera to look at themselves and move around to trigger life detection </li>
            <li> this program wroks in real time, so no matter what the user does, each visual will be unique and different</li>

    <h3 id="process2"> technical components</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>the code incorporates the use of for loops and if statesments along with scale which is what we learned in class and applies it to the poseNet tool</li>
            <li> the challenges I faced were basically trying to accurately fulfuil the prompt concept but with the material we learned in class. so i compromised by using an external library poseNet tool.</li>
            <li>if i could do this all over again, I would make my circles smaller and the shape irregular. I would also clarify everything with the professor before to ensure there is no miscommunication</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 id="process2"> reflection & future development</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> my initial proposal was a very abstract idea with little basis. My final work however was much more coherent.</li>
            <li>in my personal opinion, I executed the prompt instructions of narrative extremely well and although I was overambitious with the AI tool, I think I did the best with what I knew from class.</li>
            <li>I think I could've used more user testing with the project and in the future I would love to see how AI tools like poseNet can benefit my work considering the emminent rise of AI tools within the feild of acadameia. </li>
        </ul>
