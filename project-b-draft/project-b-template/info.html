        <h3 class = 'explain1'> What is Easter Island? </h3>
        <p class= 'explain1p2'> Easter Island is an isolated Chilean terriortory situated at the southeastern most point of the Polynesian Triangle in Oceania.
            <br> It is considered to be the most isolated location on earth, leaving mystery as to where the indigenous people actually came from or how they arrived. 
            <br> Today, the island is inhabited by a relatively small population of around 8,000 people.
            <br> Yet, although containing some of humanity's greatests feats, the world has seem to forgotten this wonder.

        <h3 class='explain1'> History of Rapa Nui or Easter island</h3>
        <p class='explain1p2'> The dates surrounding the start of the Rapa Nui civilization remain unclear, but is estimated to be around the year 800.
            <br> The early civilization arguably flourished, corroborated with the proof of advanced technology to create megalithic structures.
            <br> European's unfortunate arrival was in 1877, on Easter day leading to the name Easter Island.
            <br> The European arrival also brought disease, slave raiding expiditions, and an eventual descent of the original indigenous population.
            <br> Today, much of the Rapa Nui civilization, culture, and language has been lost to time and the methods used to build such astounding structures lost along with the rest.

        <h3 class = 'explain1'> Conspiracies Surrounding the Island</h3>
        <p class = 'explain1p2'> The methods used to not only construct, but also erect such heavy and sophisticated megaliths is highly debated amongst archaeologists. 
            <br> Suggestions of a lost form of advanced technology is discussed by some, but rejected by dogmatic archaeologists who ostracize such ideas. 
            <br> Furthermore, while the consensus amongst scholars is that the indigenous community is derived from Polynesian descent, but we still cannot decipher exactly from where.
            <br> Limitations to the island prevent sufficient scientific and archaelogical research to be conducted, and also the general lack of interest fro the public makes the island rather unimportant.

        <h3 class ='explain1'> What is the Island Today? </h3>
        <p class ='explain1p2'> Today, all inhabitants of the island have been allocated Chilean citizenship and it is considered a province of the nation.
            <br> They officially have one single airport, and a small city center named Hanga Roa. 
            <br> Prices to visit the island from Santiago, Chile near 2,000 USD, making the island a definite dream destination requiring time and money.
